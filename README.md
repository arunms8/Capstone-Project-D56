#  Food Toxicity Detection: Classifying Edible and Poisonous Mushrooms with ML

This repository contains a machine learning project that focuses on detecting food toxicity by classifying mushrooms as **edible** or **poisonous** using real-world biological data. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and interpretation using **Python** and **scikit-learn**.

---

##  Objective

The main objective of this project is to build a supervised machine learning model that can predict whether a mushroom is **safe to eat or potentially toxic**, based on its physical and biological characteristics. This project aligns with the **healthcare domain** by contributing to **food safety and poisoning prevention**.
