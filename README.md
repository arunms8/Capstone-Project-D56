# Capstone Project: Mushroom Classification using Machine Learning

## Objective
This project aims to build a machine learning model that can classify mushrooms as **edible** or **poisonous** based on various observable features. The dataset used is the **Secondary Mushroom Dataset** (UCI Repository, ID: 848).

> **Note**: This dataset is currently pending faculty approval for use in the final capstone submission.
